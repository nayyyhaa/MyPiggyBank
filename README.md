Your personal expense app.

#### User has the ability to
- Store the expense amount
- Store the income amount

This website is created using simple **VanillaJs, HTML & CSS**.

Here I've used the simple concepts of 
- Event Listeners 
- Reading input in HTML 
- Writing to DOM 
- Templating
- Processing data on user action
- Bootstraping
